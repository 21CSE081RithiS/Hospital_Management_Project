    <p1 style="color:black;text-align:left;font-size:25px;">
                Today is a landmark day for Apollo as we complete 39 years of dedicated patient care. Over the years Apollo has been he pioneer of healthcare in India, and we are humbled by the love and trust placed in us by over 200 million patients and their families.
                It has motivated us to put in tireless efforts and remain unwavering in our commitment to bring you the best healthcare in the world.

As we enter our 40th year, I want to re-affirm this commitment - Apollo will always bring you the best healthcare in the world, no matter what.
This is our mission. Today with over 10,000 beds, 400 clinics, 5,000 pharmacies and our 24/7 digital channel, we bring the best, most comprehensive omnichannel care to you wherever you are and whenever you need it.


We have the best doctors and the most care-focused teams coupled with the most advanced equipment, cutting-edge treatments and technologies, including Proton therapy, robotic surgeries, artificial intelligence and more. These ensure we can get you healthy quickly so you can get back to leading a happy and fulfilling life.
<br>
<br>



As our country emerges from the pandemic, Apollo will focus its efforts on the NCD epidemic, including diabetes, CVD and cancer. Sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets have made our youth susceptible to these chronic diseases.
Over 50% of premature mortality in India in the 30+ age group can be attributed to NCDs. India will spend around $5 trillion by 2030 to combat NCDs.

To become a developed nation, we must first ensure that we are a healthy nation, and Apollo is committed to battling the NCD epidemic to ensure the youth of our nation remains healthy and can accelerate our nation’s development.
But there is much more to be done, and I believe we are just getting started. Over the next 4 decades, we will work towards making healthcare more proactive and preventive. In fact, our measure of success would be if you never need to visit a hospital at all.
We’ve made significant investments in this area with ProHealth. It is a unique program that combines artificial intelligence, cutting-edge diagnostics and physician evaluation to provide you insights into your health risks as well as a personalised path to prevention.

 <p10> Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited is an Indian multinational healthcare group headquartered in Chennai. Along with the eponymous hospital chain, the company also operates pharmacies, primary care and diagnostic centres, telehealth clinics, and digital healthcare services among others through its subsidiaries.[3]

The company was founded by Prathap C. Reddy in 1983 as the first corporate healthcare provider in India. Several of Apollo's hospitals have been among the first in India to receive international healthcare accreditation by the America-based Joint Commission International (JCI)[4][5] as well as NABH accreditation.[6]
